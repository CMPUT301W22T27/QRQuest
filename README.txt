an older version of the intro prototype with scanning functionality

Ideas:
    we should create a user object and use that to sign in.
    methods in the user should include a save method to save qr codes to the db
    

In CreateAccount.java there's a link to the firestore db

There's also a mini demo video I added

click 'view raw' then dl the video to see it
